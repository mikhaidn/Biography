#Daniel Mikhail
## Introduction to the site

This is going to be my happy corner of personal expression. It't too early to claim any ststructured. There is one thing I want to make clear though.

I love to learn, I love to ask questions, I love to teach, and I love to scratch the itch of curiousity when I get it.

Consider this website as a Work in Progress in undetsanding how I work, produce, get creative, and pass on my lessons to other people.

(Odds are, I will heavily edit this page often. I AM NOWHERE NEAR UNDERSTANDING HOW TO CREATE MY PERSONAL BRAND. I know that I just have to take a leap of faith so here's to taking the first step.

## Introduction to the person

Howdy! How nice of you to stop in this little pocket of the internet. My name, if you haven't figured it out already is Daniel Mikhail  

At the time of writing this, I have spent nearly one year out of university doing some soul searching while warming up to the world of industry. 

In May 2018, I graduated from Rose-Hulman Institute of Toechnology with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer and Computational Science.

I had prior internships at 84.51ยบ and Linocln Financial Group.
